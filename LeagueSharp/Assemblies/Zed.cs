//TODO idea, use EvadeSpellDatabase or .dll to have an option to use ultimate to dodge dangeruous spells like Grag ult when evade can't dodge, so it doesn't waste ur R ? 
//TODO - reply here.
//TODO - when hes played more we will finish this tbh, i doubt he can carry solo q anyway too team orientated..

/* 
 * In combo it should Cast R then Items (Bork/Hydra/etc) after that everything is variable. 
 * If the enemy dashes/blinks away use W-E-Double Q. If not Zed should try to save his W shadow 
 * in case the enemy is saving his Escape for your double Q. If the enemy doesnt try to get away 
 * at all Zed should just either save his W or throw it in last second to get the double Q for his Death Mark Proc.
 * Also dodging important spells with Death Mark and Shadow Swaps should be an option confirguable spell by spell 
 * and integrated into Evade. With Shadow Swaps it should check if a specific number of enemys is around before switching 
 * and also check how far away/how close the shadow is from your target (assuming you are holding combo key down) and a check 
 * if the spell would kill you if you dont dodge it etc etc I could continue talking about such features for, well, forever.
